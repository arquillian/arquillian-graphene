* encourages to write tests in a <<page-abstractions#, consistent
level of abstraction>> using <<page-abstractions#page-objects, *Page Objects*>> and
**<<page-abstractions#page-fragments, Page Fragments>>**
* the code is **robust** with **improved readability**
** supports *<<request-guards#, request guarding>>* and
*interception*
** improved *<<graphene-utility-class#waitings, Waiting API>>*
* *allows* *WebDriver API interception*
* focuses on **portability across browsers**
* it enables *JQuery selectors as a location strategy* which is familiar
to web development community
* brings concepts for on-the-fly *injection of extensions to a page
code* (enabling advanced testing features)
* integrates with *Arquillian Core* and **Arquillian Drone** extension
