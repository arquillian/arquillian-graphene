== Graphene Utility Class
:icons: font

Graphene is an entry point for the common one-line operations:

* <<waitings, Waitings>>
* <<request-guards, Request Guards>>
* <<creating-page-fragments-dynamically, Creating Page Fragments Dynamically>>
* <<page-object-location-encapsulation, Page Object Location Encapsulation>>

[[static-import-of-graphene-utility-class]]
=== Static Import of Graphene Utility Class

The main advantage of the Graphene utility class is, that it includes
set of static methods, which can be used directly from your test:

[source,java]
----
Graphene.guardAjax(button).click();
----

This concept is much stronger when using possibilities of your IDE for
code completion.

TIP: You can use
http://help.eclipse.org/juno/index.jsp?topic=%2Forg.eclipse.jdt.doc.user%2Freference%2Fpreferences%2Fjava%2Feditor%2Fref-preferences-content-assist-favorites.htm[Eclipse
Favorites] feature and include Graphene into list of utility classes -
you will get suggestions for code-completion out of the box.

[[waitings]]
==== Waitings

Shortcut for fluent waiting API.

[source,java]
----
waitAjax();
waitGui();
waitModel();

//e.g.
button.click();
waitGui().withMessage("Popup should be opened after clicking on that button!").until().element(popupPanel).is().visible();
----

See the <<waiting-API, Waiting API>> documentation page for more information.

[[request-guards]]
==== Request Guards

It is a shortcut for the Graphene request guards, which are powerful
tools to assert that an AJAX/HTTP or no request was done.

[source,java]
----
guardAjax(Object);
guardHttp(Object);
guardNoRequest(Object);
waitForHttp(Object);

//e.g.
guardAjax(button).click();
----

`waitForHttp()` is a guard as well, even when its name does not tell it.
The difference between the `waitForHttp()` and the `guardHttp()` is that
the first one ignores AJAX requests during its waiting period and
the second one does not.

See the <<request-guards, Request Guards>> documentation page for more information.

[[creating-page-fragments-dynamically]]
==== Creating Page Fragments Dynamically

Sometimes you need a way to create a Page Fragment instance not by
injecting it via `@FindBy`, but dynamically.

[source,java]
----
createPageFragment(Class<T> clazz, WebElement root);
----

Consider a Tab Panel widget, for which you want to create a Page
Fragment. You do not know in advance how many tabs it will have and you
want to return an initialized Page Fragment with tabs content each time
user switches to a particular tab. This method is suitable for this.

[[page-object-location-encapsulation]]
==== Page Object Location Encapsulation

You can find more information about Page Object location encapsulation
on <<page-abstractions#page-objects, this>> documentation page.

Basically, you can use `Graphene.goTo()` method like this:

[source,java]
----
@Location("register.html")
public class RegistrationPage {
  //all the Page Objects FindBy, etc. goes here
}

public class TestSuite {

  public void test() {
    Graphene.goTo(RegistrationPage.class);
    //testing of the page goes here;
  }

}
----

Graphene will load `http://locahost:8080/register.html` into your
default browser.

NOTE: You can specify the browser into which the page should be loaded by
passing a browser qualifier as a
`Graphene.goTo(Class<?> pageObject, Class<?> browserQualifier)`
parameter.
