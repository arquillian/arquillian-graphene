== Overview

Graphene 2 project is designed as a set of extensions for
http://docs.seleniumhq.org/[Selenium WebDriver] project focused
on **rapid development** and **usability** in Java environment.

* API is **straight forward** and enforces tester to
write **Ajax-enabled** and **reusable** tests and test abstractions
* encourages to write tests in a <<page-abstractions#, consistent
level of abstraction>> using <<page-objects, *Page Objects*>> and
**<<page-abstractions#page-fragments, Page Fragments>>**
* the code is **robust** with **improved readability**
** supports *<<request-guards#, request guarding>>* and
*interception*
** exposes fluent *<<graphene-utility-class#waitings, Waiting API>>*
* *allows* *WebDriver API interception*
* focuses on test **portability across browsers**
* it enables *JQuery selectors as a location strategy* which is familiar
to web development community
* brings concepts for on-the-fly *injection of extensions to a page
code* (enabling advanced testing features)
* can take screenshots while testing (see
https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-graphene/blob/master/extension/screenshooter[screenshooter extension]),
and together with other useful info generate neat reports (see
https://github.com/arquillian/arquillian-recorder[Arquillian Recorder extension]).

* integrates with *Arquillian Core* and **Arquillian Drone** extension
** in order to set up browser and container integration easily

With all the concepts above, Graphene 2 brings power to space of
enterprise Java-based testing.
