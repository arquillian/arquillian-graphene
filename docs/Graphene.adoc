//https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/ARQGRA2/Graphene+Utility+Class#GrapheneUtilityClass-Waitings[Waiting
//API],*
* *allows* *WebDriver API interception*
* focuses on **portability across browsers**,
* it enables *JQuery selectors as a location strategy* which is familiar
to web development community
* brings concepts for on-the-fly *injection of extensions to a page
code* (enabling advanced testing features)
* integrates with *Arquillian Core* and **Arquillian Drone** extension
** in order to set up browser and container integration easily

With all the concepts above, Graphene 2 brings power to space of
