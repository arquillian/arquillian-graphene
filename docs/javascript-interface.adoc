== JavaScript Interface
:icons: font

In testing of complex examples, it is often needed to perform **custom
JavaScript code**. For this purposes, there is implemented JavaScript
interface mechanism providing you a mapping of Java interfaces on
JavaScript objects.

[[basic-usage]]
=== Basic Usage

[[preparation]]
==== Preparation

First, you need to create a file containing needed JavaScript code.
The code has to create an object and store it to a global scoped
variable (e.g. `window` object property) and the file has to be
available on the test classpath. Here is an example of such file:

[source,java]
.helloworld.js
----
window.helloworld = {};
window.helloworld.hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
};
----

Now you can create a Java interface:

[source,java]
.HelloWorld.java
----
@JavaScript("window.helloworld")
@Dependency(sources = "helloworld.js")
public interface HelloWorld {

    String hello();

}
----

* `@JavaScript` defines a JavaScript object used for mapping,
`window.helloworld` and `helloworld` represent the same object in this
context.
* `@Depedency` defines dependencies on files containg JavaScript code.
In this case we want to ensure that the `helloworld.js` file is loaded
to the page.
** source files are resolved from the test classpath, so in a Maven
project, you want to put those in `src/test/resources/helloworld.js`
** The `@Dependency` is indeed optional, you can map the objects from
the application under test JavaScript objects.

[[construction-and-usage]]
==== Construction and Usage

To use your JavaScript interface put an attribute annotated by
@JavaScript annotation to your test class:

[source,java]
----
@RunWith(Arquillian.class)
public class TestCase {

    // Required browser injection
    @Drone
    private WebDriver browser;

    @JavaScript
    private HelloWorld helloWorld;

    @Test
    public void testHelloWorld() {
        assertEquals("Hello World!", helloWorld.hello());
    }


}
----

[[default-getters-and-setters]]
==== Default Getters And Setters

JS interfaces functionality is often used for retrieving custom values
of custom JavaScript objects. Therefore, there is a reasonable default
in the form of getters and setters methods implemented for you.

That is why you can do just following in order to retrieve the
*someVariable* value:

[source,java]
.someJS.js
----
document.someVariable = '';
----

[source,java]
.GetterAndSettersShowcase.java
----
@JavaScript("document")
public interface GetterAndSettersShowcase {

  String getSomeVariable();

  void setSomeVariable(String valueToSet);
}
----

No need to implement get/set in the JavaScript code. Graphene will do it
automatically.

[[more-advanced-stuff]]
=== More Advanced Stuff

You may need to execute some code after the JavaScript file is loaded to
the page. Just place it into the `install()` method of your JavaScript
object and extend `InstallableJavaScript` in your Java interface. Also
you can define  dependencies on other interfaces. Graphene ensures the
`install()` method is invoked and all dependencies are loaded before you
invoke a method of your interface.

[source,java]
.greeting.js
----
// object registration
window.greeting = {
  install: function() {
    // installation setups the greeting value accessed later by helloworld object
    window.greeting.value = "Hello World!";
  }
};
----

[source,java]
.helloworld.js
----
window.helloworld = {
  // return a greeting value
  hello: function() {
    return window.greeting.value;
  }

};
----

[source,java]
.Greeting.java
----
@JavaScript("greeting")
@Dependency(sources = {"greeting.js"})
public interface Greeting extends InstallableJavaScript {
}
----

[source,java]
.HelloWorld.java
----
@JavaScript("helloworld")
@Dependency(sources = {"helloworld.js}, interfaces = {Greeting.class})
public interface HelloWorld {

    String hello();

}
----

WARNING: Graphene uses <<advance-techniques#page-extensions, Page
Extensions>> to install needed dependencies for your `@JavaScript`
interface before each method invocation. Before the installation is
processed, it checks whether the object used for mapping is defined. If
so, the installation is skipped. It means if you use (for example)
`document` object for your mapping, dependencies won't be installed
(including sources).

WARNING: When a page is reloaded, all installed JavaScript code is dropped and
installed again if needed. It means the state of JavaScript objects is
not preserved.

[[customization]]
=== Customization

If you are not satisfied with installation via
<<advance-techniques#page-extensions, Page Extensions>>,
you can implement your own `ExecutionResolver` containing
the following method:

[source,java]
----
Object execute(JSCall call);
----

Don't forget to reference it in your `@JavaScript` interfeaces:

[source,java]
----
@JavaScript(value = "mapped.object", methodResolver = YourOwnExecutionResolver.java)
...
----
