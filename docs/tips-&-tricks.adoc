= guardAjax(input).sendKeys("abc"); - Graphene 2

[[issue]]
== Issue

* The guard does not work correctly - i.e.
** it *timeouts*
** or it **ends prematurely** (when page is partially updated)

[[analysis]]
== Analysis

* `sendKeys` behaves as you would expect from a real user interaction -
**several characters are typed sequentially**, which is accompanied by
appropriate number of *keydown/keypress/keyup events* and it does not
fire any blur event
* guard actually **wraps exactly one XHR request**, which is triggered
by appropriate user interaction

[[solution]]
== Solution

* If your application triggers AJAX request when *blur* happens, then
you need to guard blur event (either click to another input or to body
element):
** `input.sendKeys("abc"); ``guardAjax(body).click();`
* If your application triggers AJAX request when keydown/keyup happens,
then you need to wait for a last update: 
** `input.sendKeys("ab"); guardAjax(input).sendKeys("c");`
